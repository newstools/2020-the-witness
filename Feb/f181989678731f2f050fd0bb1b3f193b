The hunt is on for a male lion that was spotted on a farm along the Nquthu road, a few kilometres outside Dundee. The owner of the farm where the lion was spotted told The Witness on Tuesday that the predator killed one of her calves on Saturday. It returned on Sunday night to feed on the calf’s carcass and on Monday night attempted to kill another calf. The farmer, who asked not to be named, told The Witness that some of the neighbouring farmers had placed a motion-sensitive camera near where the lion was last seen on her property and managed to capture a picture of the large cat during the night. The farmer said it was still a mystery where the lion may have escaped from, as there were no game reserves close to her farm except for Nambiti Private Game Reserve. “We did contact Nambiti Private Game Reserve to ask if it was their lion, but they said all their lions had collars and had been accounted for,” she said.

He said the plan was not to kill the lion, but to sedate it and relocate it to a protected area. In November 2018, The Witness reported about a Vryheid man, Sabelo Mbense, who was lucky to survive a lion attack in the farming village of Gluckstadt. Mbense escaped with bruises under his right armpit. That lion was never captured. Ezemvelo KZN spokesperson Musa Mntambo said they were aware of reports and were investigating the matter. He said they were also searching for the lion with help from local farmers. Mntambo added that in the past couple of years, there had been reports of two lions roaming around Vryheid. He said one of the lions was killed by the public, but ithe other was never captured. He said the lion on the loose at Dundee might be the same animal.
