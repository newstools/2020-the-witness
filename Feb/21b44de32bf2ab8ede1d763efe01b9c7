The young woman who said she was abducted and raped on Saturday confessed to fabricating the crime on Tuesday. On Tuesday an announcement posted by her sister on Twitter said the investigation results proved that it was all a hoax, and that the police were dealing with the matter. “We apologise for all your spiritual, emotional and physical energy spent on helping us when we reached out to you. As a family, we are still hurting physically and emotionally,” the sister said in the post. The young woman’s brother-in-law told The Witness on Tuesday that the family were shocked when police told them that everything their sister had told them was a lie, and that the young woman was actually with her boyfriend and friends during the time she claimed to have been abducted. The brother-in-law said police were trying to establish what made their sister make up such a lie. “As a family, we do not know what drove her to this,” he said. The young woman claimed to have been abducted on Saturday when she was walking out of the Pep store at Capital Centre. She had told the police she was taken away in a vehicle that had seven other girls inside, and “three or more” abductors. She was then “found” on Sunday at the Market Square taxi rank, where her brother-in-law had described her as looking “physically assaulted and emotionally unstable” and said that she was still drugged at the time. Police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said there are further investigations that they needed to follow regardless of her confession as there were many factors to consider in her original story.
