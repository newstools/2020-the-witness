Taxis illegally parked on Greyling Street and Walthew Square Road in the vicinity of Alston Primary School are proving to be a nuisance to residents there. Malvern McKenzie, who lives there, told The Witness on Wednesday that the taxis arrive in the morning to drop off school children and remain parked there throughout the day until it’s time to take the pupils home. McKenzie said that apart from parking in a prohibited area, they leave their trash scattered on the pavements. McKenzie told The Witness of an incident in April 2019, where he was threatened by approximately six men when he wanted to get into his property. “Their taxis were parked outside my gate and were blocking my entry. When I asked them to leave, they told me that I should find somewhere else to park. “I let the situation go because there were six of them against just me,” said McKenzie. There are also large potholes along Greyling Street, which McKenzie said had been reported many times but had not been repaired. The Ward 32 councillor, Shawn Adkins of the DA, confirmed the potholes had been reported to Msunduzi Municipality. “It has been listed on the IDP for the past two financial years. Unfortunately, it is a well-known fact that Msunduzi Municipality is under administration due to bad financial practices resulting in poor service delivery,” said Adkins, who did not respond on the issue of the taxis parking illegally.
