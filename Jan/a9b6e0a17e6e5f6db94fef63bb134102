Taps have run dry in parts of Edendale. Hundreds of residents in Caluza, Snathing, Dambuza and Smero have been left without water for two weeks. Explaining the lack of water in the area, Msunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said a key water supply pipeline that provides water to the affected areas was damaged during a storm on January 18. “It appears that one of the homeowners in the area excavated near the pipe, reducing its ground cover and support. We have engaged with a contractor to do some gabion work, but they are still awaiting the delivery of the material,” Mafumbatha said. Residents in the area told The Witness that while the municipality was aware of the water crisis, no water tankers had been dispatched to the affected areas. Amanda Mshengu, an angry resident, said: “We have no water supply and it’s really unfair. “Water is a basic need; the municipality should at least dispatch tankers while they work on fixing the pipeline. I have a child who attends school and it is draining to some of us as we have to wake up at dawn to try and get water.” Another resident who asked to remain unnamed said they have had water problems in the area before, but it is the first time that it has lasted this long. “No one even knows what the problem is, despite reporting to the ward councillor, Nelisiwe Ndlovu. There has not been a community meeting to clarify what is happening. The only people who are at an advantage are those with cars as they are able to fetch water from anywhere,” he said. Others said that if they can’t get to the areas with water, they have to ask for water from their neighbours. Councillor Ndlovu said the problem in the area was the old infrastructure. “Unfortunately, the municipality is also faced with a shortage of water tankers, which worsens the situation. I was given assurance that a contractor has been appointed and the rehabilitation work will begin soon,” said Ndlovu.
