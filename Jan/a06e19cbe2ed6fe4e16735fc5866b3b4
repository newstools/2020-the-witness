Drone flyers beware: your precious flying contraption could
very well be shot out of the sky if it strays over private property. That is according to the Private Drone Association of SA,
which said flying a drone into private property would constitute trespassing. “But I would probably advise chucking something at the
drone, or reporting it to the authorities instead of shooting,” the
association’s Warren Gardiner said. “If it’s bothering you and it has no permission to be near
your house, you can attack the drone. That is the law,” he said, adding that
police can be called to intervene. “We usually advise people not to fly their drones just
anywhere, and to stay away from roads and not to fly too high.” Gardiner said the popularity of using drones for casual
purposes, like taking video footage, had grown over the years, adding that
there was a huge misconception that a person needed a license to fly one. “You
only need a license if you’re going to be making money from using the drone. “For this, a person would need to get a drone license, a
flying license and a license to use it for business purposes. This can be done
through accredited organisations.” Casual drone flyers are also not allowed to fly their
machines within a 10km radius of any airfield or airport, near national key
points, courts, prisons or power stations. They can also not be flown in national parks overseen by
SANParks like the Kruger National Park. It is advisable to keep them clear of
sports fields, stadiums and schools. Casual flyers should always deploy the
drone in well-lit places and in clear weather conditions. An inspection of the
drone should also be done before each flight. A query sent to police went unanswered.
