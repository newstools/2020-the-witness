A Couple in Woodlands feel helpless after repeatedly reporting a maintenance hole that overflows after heavy rains, flooding Mbhokodo Road and their home. Derick Mkhize told The Witness on Wednesday that he has been living at his home since 1994 and has been reporting the issue of flooding since 2010. Mkhize said he had spoken to numerous ward councillors and municipal staff about the problem to no avail. “Councillors have come to our home over the years and seen the damage that the water caused. “I had been told that the manhole would be attended to; yet here we are. Two weeks ago, my fence collapsed after being pushed over by the force of the water on the road,” said Mkhize. Mkhize’s wife, Nomusa, told The Witness on Wednesday that she last reported the issue to the municipality and the ward councillor in December, but has not had any feedback. Mkhize added that he has had to get rid of a lot of furniture and home appliances because it all gets ruined after the water soaks his home. “I have spent so much money replacing wardrobes and kitchen cupboards because the moisture completely damages them, which becomes a health hazard for my wife and I,” said Mkhize.  A man walks around the ‘mini lake’ in Woodlands, balancing on Derick Mkhize’s collapsed fence. He said that when the floods occur and the road gets blocked by the stream that develops, locals are forced to climb the bank on the side of the street to get across. “It’s not safe for people to climb there. The bank is muddy and slippery after the rains, so I even worry about the children who travel that route,” said Mkhize. Ward 32 councillor Shawn Adkins said yesterday: “We fear that there could be a fatality if this vital infrastructure is not rectified. Both myself and the ward committee will continue to engage officials on this matter,” said Adkins. The municipality did not respond to media queries.
