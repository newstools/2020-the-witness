Patient Zero, the country’s first Covid-19 patient, was discharged from Grey’s Hospital on Wednesday afternoon. The Midlands man, who was diagnosed positive and been in isolation in hospital since March 5, was joined by his wife, who tested positive a few days later, and their two sons. Although he and his wife have not received their two negative tests giving them the all-clear from the virus, they will remain in isolation at a granny flat on their property. “It’s awesome to report that we are being discharged ... We are yet to test negative and therefore have to be responsible and remain in isolation at home in the granny flat and separate from the children but at least it’s a positive step. The hospital is concerned for our recovery if exposed to new patients in the ward. “Thanks for all the support and messages. It’s so special to be back home,” said the excited man. He told The Witness on Tuesday the family did not receive any treatment while in hospital — as they “were okay” even though they tested positive. Patient Zero, his wife and a group of eight other friends travelled to Livigno in the most affected province of Lombardy, Italy, on February 21 — just as the outbreak hit there. Seven from the group tested positive, with one patient hospitalised in Gauteng, and four others at a Durban hospital.
