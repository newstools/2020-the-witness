Tuesday afternoon’s storm wreaked havoc in the Midlands leaving two people injured, many homes damaged and several roads flooded. Parts of the canopy at the Sasol garage in Mpophomeni collapsed during the heavy downpour accompanied by hail on Tuesday afternoon, damaging four cars and injuring two people, who were taken to hospital. A Howick resident, who saw the collapse, posted on his Facebook page: “Just got home after being trapped in a massive storm on the way back from the school. Hiding under trees!!! Huge hail, lightning, wind, the works. Cars stopped all over the roads trying to find shelter from the hail. Visibilty zero, noise of hail stones on vehicle like being fired on by a nest of machine gunners ... The garage in this picture was 500 m from where I was sheltering ...” Attempts to contact the garage last night were unsuccessful. Janis Holmes, a ward councillor in the Howick area, said many residents in Merrivale Heights, Mpophomeni and on Tumbleweed Road were flooded out of their homes by the heavy but brief storm. Holmes said she didn’t have reports of specific incidents, just flooding in people’s homes, but there were no reports of houses that had collapsed. There were also reports that several sections of the R33 in Mpolweni were flooded last night. Senzelwe Mzila, spokesperson for the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), said disaster management teams as well as ward committee members in the affected areas were dispatched last night to help those affected.
