A powerful image of a woman who has been silenced with a gag is the focal point of a mural being painted on one side of the pedestrian bridge near Edendale Hospital. KwaPata resident Siyabonga Ngubane is the artist behind the work, which forms part of the second edition of the ReRouting Arts Festival, which runs from March 13 to 20 at locations around Pietermaritz­burg. Ngubane has been working on his first mural for the past five days. “I wanted to create a piece which focuses on gender abuse because it happens in our communities every day,” he said. “I really hope that the people who see the mural will learn that they should not abuse each other.” The mural is one of two being painted on the bridge columns. On the hospital side, a group of young artists, all of whom attend the Tatham Art Gallery’s weekly art classes, were working on the second mural. Sandisiwe Mnyamdu, from KaMpumuza­; Juma Nyundo, from France; Siyabonga Ngcobo, from KwaPata; Nkanyiso Dladla, from Imbali; and Mfundo Nkandi, from eSigodini­ intend painting the joyful faces of children. Residents wanting to see the results of the artists’ work will be able to join a tour hosted by Rob Haswell at 10 am on Sunday, March 15. Tickets are R80, and the tour starts at the YMCA parking lot.
