A man gunned down in his car in Chapel Street on Friday has been identified by police as local attorney Vusumuzi Mkhulise (48). Mkhulise was found lying in his vehicle after the shooting. SAPS spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese told The Witness on Sunday that according to their information Mkhulise was in his vehicle when he was intercepted by a blue Hyundai in which three armed men were travelling. Ngobese said the attackers had tried to open Mkhulise’s door but it was locked, and that is when they shot at the lock until the door opened. Ngobese said the men then shot Mkhulise and fled the scene. It was not known if anything was taken. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said in a statement released after the shooting that several bullets were found in the vehicle. According to paramedics, Mkhulise had sustained a gunshot wound to his back. Initially in a critical condition, he was taken to hospital where he later died. Ngobese said that the motive for the shooting was not known at this stage as police investigations are still ongoing. A friend of Mkhulise’s, Thabani Khumalo, told The Witness on Sunday that his death has sent shockwaves through all those who knew him. Khumalo said there was speculation that Mkhulise had just withdrawn money from an ATM, and that he was followed by thugs who attacked him in order to rob him. Khumalo said his friend was a great man who will be sorely missed. He described Vusi as “down to earth” with a big heart. He said that his character was seen in the way that he had conducted his work. “He always did his work thoroughly and made it a point to help those who were less fortunate. “He did not care about securing ‘big clients’,” said Khumalo. Mkhulise’s wife, Londiwe Mkhulise, was not available to speak to The Witness on Sunday.
