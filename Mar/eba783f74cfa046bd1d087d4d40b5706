Staff at the licensing department in Pietermaritzburg refused to serve customers on Monday, saying they did not want to risk getting the coronavirus. Between 60 and 80 people who wanted to renew their car licences queued from 8 am, only to be sent away at around midday. Security guards told motorists arriving at the shut gates of the building that the staff had refused to work. One motorist, whose name is known to The Witness, said only one counter was operating when he arrived early yesterday morning. “There was someone working at the bulk counter. They were wearing a mask. None of the other counters had any staff,” he added. “The stated reason was that they didn’t want to get coronavirus.” It was the second time in the space of a few days that the department had been closed for business. Last Friday, staff downed tools at 9.30 am as part of a strike and members of the public were told to return on Monday. In a statement, the Department of Transport (DoT) said they were aware of the actions of the staff at the licensing centre and considered it “as a sign of misconduct” that would be dealt with by the labour section. Spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane said that while they understood the concerns of staff, it was “regrettable when staff use the virus as an excuse not to perform their services to the public”. The department also urges staff not to panic as they are satisfied with the manner in which the Department of Health (DoH) has handled the issue. In a circular sent to staff, the DoT said no masks or hand sanitiser would be provided until the DoH advised anything different. They also urged staff who thought they had symptoms or might have been exposed to the virus to contact the hotline at 0800 029 999.
