Premier Sihle Zikalala announced on Wednesday that provincial government departments would be forced to employ young staff by providing 500 000 “work opportunities” over five years. Tabling his State Of the Province Address (Sopa) at the Royal Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday, Zikalala said the programme will include “internships, learnerships, in-service training etc”. “Our wish is that in end there will be no graduate in KZN who will be forced to sit at home after completing their studies,” he said. KZN has a 26% youth unemployment rate. Through the government’s Eye­sizwe Contractor Development Programme, the provincial government has already granted contracts worth R47 million to businesses owned by young entrepreneurs. In addition, the bulk of the more than 135 000 jobs created through the provincial government’s Expanded Public Works Programme went to young people. Zikalala said thousands more unemployed youth in the province will benefit from the Transport Department’s works programme, which is set to create 63 000 jobs in the current financial year. “This will include 4 000 newly-recruited youth under the Vukayi­bambe Road Maintenance Programme. Working with the Office of the Premier, the Department of Transport has already recruited 850 young people who will be part of the National Youth Service,” he said. While both the IFP and DA welcome Zikalala’s announcement, the DA said it was concerned that only young people affiliated to the ANC would be benefit from the programme.
