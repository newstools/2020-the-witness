A Pietermaritzburg woman who works at the Mkondeni municipal
market and has recently returned from a trip to India has tested positive for
Covid-19. The market has since been closed and will only re-open once
it has been deep cleansed. It is not clear yet when that will happen as
Msunduzi is awaiting an update from the National Institute of Communicable
Diseases (NICD). The 50-year-old woman, who had travelled to India on
February 29 with several relatives and her six-year-old daughter, fell ill a
few days after her return on March 21 but only saw a doctor on Thursday, where
she tested positive via a blood test. She has been admitted to a local private hospital. The
mother-of-four had toured various parts of India, including Goa, and had
returned via Dubai to Johannesburg and then to King Shaka Airport. A person close to the woman said she had warned her not to
travel overseas because of the virus outbreak but the woman thought she would
be safe. “I told her not to go but she said she had already paid for her trip
and the infection rate was not so high in India. I kept messaging her while she
was there, advising her to be safe. “When she returned she complained of severe lower back pain
and reduced usage of her left side. She then broke out into a very high fever
and was just sweating so much that her bed was wet. Her husband eventually took
her to a private doctor,” said the woman. She said despite being unwell, she had returned to work as
her supervisor had insisted she present herself at work, even though she
advised she had returned from abroad and needed to quarantine herself. “As a
result now, many people at the market — staff and customers — have all come in
contact with her. Her relatives, who travelled with her, are also being tested
— despite protests that they did not want to be tested,” said the woman. The woman is said to be in a stable condition but with
full-blown symptoms. The NICD is in the process of tracing all of the woman’s
direct contacts.
