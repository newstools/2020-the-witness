Keep calm and get the flu vaccine. That’s the word from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, which on Thursday said the Covid-19 case found in KZN indicates the strength of their surveillance and South Africa’s health systems to detect and rapidly identify cases. In a statement last night, they said the case has been isolated and containment measures are ongoing including the monitoring of contacts. “It is important to note that the identification of a single imported case in a traveller from an area with widespread community transmission does not mean that Covid-19 is currently spreading in South African communities. “The risk to the general community of acquiring Covid-19 remains low. The NICD wishes to stress that the evidence available to date suggests that the vast majority of cases of Covid-19 (>80%) have mild illness and severe illness is predominantly in the elderly and those with underlying illnesses who are also at risk of other respiratory infections.” The NICD said the influenza season is approaching and the influenza vaccine will soon be widely available. They encourage the public to get the influenza vaccine to reduce the chance of illness which may be confused with Covid-19, as influenza presents similar signs as Covid-19.
