Three elderly people were attacked at their home during a robbery in Hayfields on Friday evening. Police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said police are investigating a case of house robbery. Two women aged 79 and 81 and a man aged 77, were tied up by two suspects, who stole items were from the house. When The Witness went to the house on Saturday, the residents did not want to say anything about what had happened. Ngobese said this was an isolated matter and it was premature to link it to other recent cases. Just last week, an elderly couple, James Speedie and his wife Doreen, were brutally attacked in their home during an armed robbery in Hilton. Doreen was home alone at the time having a nap on a couch when the men accessed the property after breaking a padlock on an exterior property gate. They then removed a glass pane and got into the house. James came afterwards. The suspects punched, kicked and threw James against the wall; and continued to do so until he fell to the ground. He was then dragged out of the house and assaulted further and left on the driveway before they made off with two vehicles. This attack is believed to be the work of an organised syndicate operating in Pietermaritzburg and Hilton, targeting the elderly. Sources had previously told The Witness the gang members were slick in their operation and only went after electronic items, laptops, jewellery — specifically diamonds — and money.
