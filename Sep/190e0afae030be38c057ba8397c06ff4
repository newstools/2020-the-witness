NEWS  Noris Rusell Mutambaziko, an 18-year-old Zimbabwean national, appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday charged with Mubvakure’s murder and with stealing her cellphone. He has been remanded in custody until next week. Prior to his court appearance, he made a confession about the killing to a senior magistrate. Afterwards, he was taken to a district surgeon to be examined to determine if he has been assaulted. This is usual procedure that is followed because some accused challenge their confessions at the trial stage. Many say they were forced to make their confession because they were assaulted. Impeccable sources close to the case said that Mutambaziko killed Mubvakure because a prophet/sangoma told him to do so. The source told The Witness that the prophet — who has also been arrested but has not appeared in court yet — allegedly told Mutambaziko that if his father died he would not get anything.  The Witness reported this week that the man’s father, Chino Mutambaziko (54), had taken the woman’s car to a mechanic and stopped for groceries on his way back. When he returned to the house just after 3 pm, his four-year-old son, who was covered in his mother’s blood, ran to him and broke the news of her death. Mubvakure was a cleaner in the offices of a Pietermaritzburg law firm and Mutambaziko runs a plumbing business.
