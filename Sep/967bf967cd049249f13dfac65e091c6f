A stern warning has been sent to illegal land grabbers in Greytown after more than 50 people erected illegal structures in the Bomvini area near Merthley Lake. uMvoti Local Municipality, which owns the land, has obtained an interdict to prevent illegal land grabbing in the area and warned the community to refrain from erecting illegal structures. Residents told The Witness that community members who had attended a meeting last week were not happy about the court interdict. Community leader Moses Zakwe said the mushrooming of illegal structures at the farm was caused by people coming from outside the area. He believed that the increasing number of illegal occupants near the lake would have a negative impact on the environment and the dam. The dam supplies water to the Greytown community and nearby townships such as Angola and Solomon. “This is our ancestral land. Other residents have already marked their sites. I fear that this matter will result in violence because community members vowed to take the law into their hands. We have calmed them down and told them to respect the court interdict. We have been living at peace until some of the residents invited their relatives and friends to erect illegal structures in the farm,” he said. Another resident, Mpilo Mazeka, confirmed that a group of land grabbers invaded eBomvini farm. Spokesperson for uMvoti Local Municipality Phindile Phungula said the municipality was not evicting residents, saying the municipality had a court interdict to stop anyone from land grabbing. “Bomvini is a settlement that developed from forest workers and now has external people entering the limited site area. The land was never earmarked to hold more people than what it holds currently under the title of farm dwellers. “The municipality warned the community of the environmental hazard that the unlawful occupiers posed to Lake Merthley and its supply of water to the Greytown area,” Phungula added.
