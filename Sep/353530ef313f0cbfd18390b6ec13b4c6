Hundreds of residents at Jika Joe informal settlement in
Pietermaritzburg were left homeless after their shacks were razed by yet
another fire on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze was suspected to have been caused by an illegal
electricity connection. There were no deaths but three children suffered minor
burn wounds and were rushed to the nearest clinic. ALSO READ: 'No one deserves a life like this' - KwaZulu-Natal fire victims relocated to waterlogged site Most of the people who lost their homes were also victims of
the March fire which destroyed more than 20 shacks. They said they were still
in the process of rebuilding their lives when Wednesday’s fire erupted. Pride Zho, who only managed to escape with her 12-month old
son Asanda Abdul and his nappy bag, could not even get to their identity
documents before the smoke engulfed her shack. Tavern owner Bonisile Thusi lost two fridges, a sound system
and more than 30 cases of beer. She was not home when the blaze started and by
the time she received the call from her neighbours it was too late to save
anything.  Some of the shack dwellers tried to help the fire fighters
by pouring buckets of water over the flames but that did nothing to quell the
inferno so they eventually gave up. Mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla was amongst those who  rushed to the scene when news of the fire
broke out. He said all available emergency and rescue resources had
been deployed to fight the blaze. “Our thoughts are with the victims during this terrible
ordeal and we are responding with all available resources. Our disaster
management teams will work tirelessly to help the affected residents with
humanitarian assistance,” said the Mayor. Thebolla said the electricity supply in the affected
vicinity would be switched off and appealed for patience from neighbouring
communities.
