NEWS  Safe City said at about 10 am on Monday an operator was monitoring an area in Church street, just above Boshoff Street, that is known for street robberies and theft out of motor vehicles. The operator observed two known suspects walking towards Boshoff street. They stopped outside a fast food outlet where a white LDV was parked. Both approached the vehicle and one of the suspects lifted the tonneau cover at the back and removed a child’s green bicycle. The operator immediately informed the SAPS officer who was on duty in the control room and he requested quick SAPS response. “The two suspects were followed by the operator while they proceeded down Church towards Slater Street. When they tried to sell the bicycle at a shop, they were apprehended by the SAPS. “Both suspects were arrested and taken to the Pietermaritzburg Central police station and charged for theft out of a motor vehicle.” Safe City said the vehicle owner was unaware that the bicycle had been stolen until told about the arrest. Safe City appealed to the public to ensure that their valuables are concealed and secured before leaving their vehicles. They also appealed to shop owners not to buy possible stolen goods from anyone.
