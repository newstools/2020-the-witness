NEWS  Yasmin Maharaj, the sister of the murdered man, David Stieger (33), said she arrived at the family home soon after the shooting. “He was lying in a pool of blood. There was so much of blood on the floor. My nephew [Aldaine Tyronne Maharaj] was holding his shirt against his back. I put my hand on his feet. It felt warm. “I believed that he was in shock and that he would be alright,” she said. Maharaj said she thought Stieger had been stabbed with a screwdriver before she was told he had been shot. The ambulance arrived over an hour after it was contacted. Police arrived before the paramedics, she said. The incident happened between 1 am and 2 am yesterday. Aldaine Maharaj was the only other person in the house at the time. Although he was not present during the interview with The Witness, Yasmin Maharaj repeated what he had told her. She said he heard a noise and Stieger scream and took out his bushknife. As he entered the passage he saw a man who said something to him in Zulu. The man then ran out. She said he saw three men and her nephew chased after them but it was too dark to follow them. The suspects had cut a hole in the back fence to enter the yard. He said they had broken the front door latch. He had also indicated the direction with which they had gone. She said that a few weeks ago, a bedroom window was open and someone pulled some of Stieger’s valuables out. Mountain Rise police station spokesperson Warrant Officer Joshua Maistry said that Stieger was asleep when he heard noises at the front door. When he went to the door, one shot was fired by the suspects. The bullet, said Maistry, went through the closed door, hitting Stieger in his stomach. He died a few minutes later. Maistry added that a TV set and cellphone were stolen from the house before the suspects fled the crime scene. Anyone with information on the crime should contact the head of detective services, Colonel Sibongiseni Phoswa, at 079 500 0264.
