Police Minister Bheki Cele says crime “should not be allowed to get as wayward as it has in KZN” with the killings of nine people in KwaNdengezi near Pinetown over the weekend. Cele was speaking to the media after visiing the families of the slain people on Monday. He said he will look into allocating more resources for KwaZulu-Natal. Six people were attacked while returning from a party in KwaNdengezi on Saturday. They were ordered out of a car and shot execution-style. One of them survived and is in critical condition. “These things should not be allowed to happen. It should be allowed to get as wayward as it has in KwaZulu-Natal. These killings of the nine people is serious. We will look at getting more resources to KZN to help out,” said Cele. Cele said details surrounding the crime were still sketchy. “The other information ... they say those people were together [from] where they came from. Others they say they met on the way. They were ordered to get out by one man. He then told them to sleep on their stomachs and shot them. No argument, nothing. So it is very difficult to work on motive at the moment,” Cele said. With regards to the other incident, where four people were killed in the same area, Cele said detectives had a clearer idea about the murders. “They are accused of having committed some kind of crime. They talk about stock theft and all that, and it looks like those people were picked and put in one place and executed. “We are told they were involved in some kind of crime. But I want to say that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands. “So now, they too, have committed a crime by killing these people and will be treated as such,” he said. Cele said he would return in two weeks to update the community.
