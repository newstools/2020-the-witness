Giving a platform to people with disabilities, activist and radio presenter Andile ‘MC Pholobas’ Ngcobo (29) has launched his own online radio station called Siyaviva.

Before establishing Siyaviva, Ngcobo worked at another radio station for over a decade as a producer and hosted a traditional programme. While there, Ngcobo was encouraged to fight against discrimination faced by people with disabilities and to create content to fight the seclusion they faced. He said half the staff at Siyaviva are people with disabilities, while the other half are women and youth. Siyaviva, which means, “we are getting ready” in Zulu, is based in the Cornubia Flats on the North Coast. The radio station has an accompanying YouTube channel that shows the staff at work, which Ncgobo says helps to visually create awareness surrounding people with disabilities and their capabilities in the workplace while dispelling misconceptions. Ncgobo said the station could not have happened if it was not for people like Dr Nondela Mzimba Dlamini, who bought broadcasting equipment worth R40 000.
