The Epworth board of governors has named a collective leadership team which will be known as the school executive to replace the current head of school, Laura Bekker, who retires at the end of the year. Tracey Munro, current deputy head (academics) in the high school has been appointed principal of the high school. Munro, who joined Epworth in 1998 as a mathematics and physical sciences teacher, holds a BSc and HDE from the University of the Witwaters­rand and an MSc from the University of Notre Dame (USA). Her extensive academic and leadership experience, coupled with the popularity she enjoys among the pupils, will stand her in good stead, Epworth said in a statement. She will be joined by the existing principal of the preparatory school, Reynard White and the school’s business manager, Emwee Zeelie, to form the new team that will assume leadership of the school from 2021. The appointment of the school executive is the culmination of an 11-month process that evolved from seeking a head of whole school and/or a principal of the high school, to embracing an innovative and collaborative leadership structure for Epworth. Chairperson of the Epworth board, Lisa Robertson, said: “Choosing the leadership of a school is one of the single greatest responsibilities of a board of governors, and for Epworth, this process has concluded with this innovative and exciting outcome that is the result of work by many.” Each member of the newly formed school executive will continue to retain responsibility for their respective roles, but together they will manage decisions and responsibilities of a whole-school nature. “They will continue to uphold Epworth’s 122-year heritage and will commit to ensuring Epworth’s sustainable future,” the school’s statement said. — WR
