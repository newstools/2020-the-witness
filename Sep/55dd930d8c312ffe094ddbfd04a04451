The destruction and theft of granite tombstones at burial sites in Greytown has devastated families. Tombstones and granite slabs are either removed or dismantled, and the destruction has most recently affected Gijima — a new burial site that belongs to uMvoti Local Municipality. According to family members, vandalism started at the old Greytown Cemetery a few years ago. A family member of two people whose graves were vandalised at Gijima Cemetery said the two tombstones with a value of more than R20 000 were dismantled and the graves, of her late mother Ntombizonke Mlangeni and her aunt Zanele Mlangeni, vandalised. Another resident, Fikile Zakwe, said she lost her sister Philisiwe Zakwe a few years ago. “I have spent R39 000 to buy a tombstone for my sister. We suspect that the people vandalising the burial site only target graves with expensive tombstones. These stolen items from the graves are being used for commercial resale. I have not replaced the stolen items because the site is insecure and unguarded. The municipality must deploy a security guard at the cemetery,” Zakwe said.
