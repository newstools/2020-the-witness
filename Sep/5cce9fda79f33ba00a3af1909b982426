NEWS  The outcome of the assessment highlighted a number of significant concerns with the condition of the buildings. Normah Zondo, acting executive director: Corporate Relations, said in a media release that due to the significant risks associated with the continued occupation of the buildings, a decision had been taken to close it indefinitely. She said about 181 students were affected. “The university conducts routine assessments of all its buildings. During the assessment, it discovered that the Oval Residence did not meet with the municipality’s regulations for occupancy. All relevant authorities will be consulted with regards to the future of the building,” said Zondo.  Students who normally live on those premises have been asked to remain at their homes until further notice. The university is already in the process of seeking alternative suitable accommodation for the students who have already returned to the Oval Residence. The Department of Student Residence Affairs will be communicating with these students regarding arrangements for their relocation, said Zondo. All affected students will not be charged accommodation fees. — WR.
