Police officers from various units in Pietermaritzburg
closed off streets in the CBD on Friday and conducted roadblocks to ensure that
motorists and residents were adhering to level 4 lockdown restrictions. The officers from the Pietermaritzburg K9 and mounted unit,
search and rescue and the accident combating unit conducted roadblocks at
various entry and exit points to the city. Motorists and passengers were asked to produce travel
permits or were hit with merciless fines for breaking strict lockdown
regulations. This came while some concerned residents were still
complaining about people who seemed to be roaming around the CBD without
permission. The officers ensured them that every vehicle they let
through had the permission to head into town. Passengers in taxis were also
asked to produce their identification and permits. The officers were also ensuring that passengers were seated
in accordance with regulations meant to minimise unnecessary contact. Motorist Mike Smit complemented the officers for their great
work to ensure that people were not doing as they pleased. “This is really
great to see ... People who are not in essential services have no reason to be
on the streets unless it’s an emergency or they need to go and buy food. Those
found taking chances should be arrested because they are making things worse,”
he said. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Mthokozisi Ngobese
said: “While the greater majority of people are complying with the lockdown,
there are still people that are not. We are identifying areas where there is
limited compliance on an ongoing basis and we are intensifying patrols and
increasing roadblocks by our joint security forces.”
