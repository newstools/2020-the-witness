The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health has said it will not close healthcare facilities that have treated Covid-19 patients. This is after Imbali Unit 3 residents questioned why Imbalenhle Clinic was not closed after two patients were said to have tested positive for the virus there over the weekend. Almost two weeks ago, the department announced that the General Justice Gizenga Memorial hospital, formerly the Stanger hospital, was closed after at least 16 people tested positive. The hospital is not the only one that was closed because of positive cases, but the department, led by MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, said facilities will only be temporarily closed to allow for decontamination, if need be. “As a matter of principle, where a positive Covid-19 case has been identified, contact mapping and tracing has to be conducted as well as the screening, testing, quarantining and isolation of people who have come into contact with the patient,” said spokesperson for Health in the province, Ntokozo Maphisa. “Where necessary and warranted, the affected section of a health facility may be temporarily closed in order to allow for decontamination. All of this is in line with Infection Control and Prevention guidelines from the World Health Organisation.” Maphisa also said the province would not be able to confirm if Imbalenhle Clinic did have positive cases as disseminating information of positive cases is the sole preserve of the Health minister.
