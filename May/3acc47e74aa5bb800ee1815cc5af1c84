Only old age and disability grants will be paid out on Monday and Tuesday. The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has decided to stagger the payment of grants from this month to avoid having large numbers of people turning up at pay points at the same time. The agency’s spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi, on Thursday said the only child support grants that will be paid on these days are those linked to the cards of the old age and disability beneficiaries. For all other grant payments, money will be available from May 6. Letsatsi said this is to avoid last month’s chaos, which was partly fueled by panic. He appealed to grants beneficiaries not to stand close to each other in the queues, even if there is no security guard watching them. On the transport side, the uMgungundlovu regional chairperson of South African National Taxi Council (Santaco), Bheki Sokhela, said they are ready for the influx of people wanting to travel to the CBD as level 4 of the lockdown will also see many returning to work on Monday. “Level 4 means that taxis get to operate throughout the day and only cut off when the curfew starts in the evening, so we are not going to have the problems we had last month during the grant pay-out days where people were stuck in the CBD for long hours because we were not allowed to operate.” Sokhela said the relaxation on their operating hours will not ease the financial pressure on the sector. He said the taxi industry is essentially operating at a loss as they are not making enough to even cover the business expenses, let alone a profit. He appealed to passengers to put on masks or cover their mouths with scarves from today when they hail a taxi as this is now mandatory. “If you are travelling for work or funeral, please keep the relevant documents handy because the law enforcement officers will not let the taxi pass at a roadblock until you produce them.”
