A Hilton businessman, Dave Bure, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon for running a car sanitising business at the Engen Garage on Chief Albert Luthuli Street. This was despite the fact that he allegedly had certificates from the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) allowing him to operate, according to his wife. Bure was arrested for allegedly contravening the lockdown regulations and for resisting arrest. His wife, Gill, told The Witness that there was a stand-off between her husband and three police officers who had come to the Engen Garage, which is also under their management, to arrest her husband. “My husband had to shut himself inside the office while trying to explain to the officers that he had a certificate to operate and also trying to tell them that we were not running a carwash but a car sanitising station. “The police said the certificates were invalid as they were not actual certificates but were applications for certificates. They were also saying they wanted to arrest him and keep him overnight. This is what is happening, citizens are getting harassed for things police also don’t understand,” she said. Bure’s attorney, Reial Mahabeer, told The Witness that his client was released on bail on Wednesday night and they would defend the matter and pursue a damages claim.
