VIC Pillay, former principal of ML Sultan Secondary School has died. His brother-in-law Krish Moodley said that having obtained a first class pass in Matric, Pillay studied medicine at the University of Natal, but after six weeks he made the painful decision to leave, as he couldn’t afford to pay his fees. As one educationist so poignantly put it at his funeral: “Medicine’s loss was education’s gain.” Pillay was described as a veritable giant in Indian education, an ardent participant and enthusiast of every sport conceivable as well as a man deeply devoted to the Indian culture and religion. “He made his presence felt at many cultural events in and around the city and spoke eloquently whenever he was called upon to do so. He was in such demand to grace these events that I often wondered where he summoned the energy to oblige,” said Moodley. As executive director of Indian education and former principal of ML Sultan secondary school, he made huge strides in Indian education and his contribution was enviable. Moodley said that Pillay instilled in his three children and grandchildren such discipline and respect for hard work that: His daughter Rosh made an excellent history teacher with tremendous and valuable experience, both in South Africa, and the UK. His son Thasee is an eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon with sterling experience in the UK, U.S., Europe, India and the United Arab Emirates. His son Yougan is a highly regarded doctor in Newcastle-upon-Tyne; his granddaughter, Kiara a student of veterinary medicine and his grandson, Yureesh who is so rapidly following in the footsteps of his granddad is becoming a prolific sportsman as well as a trailblazer. “He will also sadly be missed by his wife Devi. “Vic remarked not so long ago when he had just returned from hospital: ‘Devi has been an excellent nurse.’,” said Moodley.
