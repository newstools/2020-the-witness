Former president Jacob Zuma, who has been skipping court due to ill-health, has apparently recovered from his undisclosed illness. This is according to sources close to Zuma who told The Witness he was relaxing at his Nkandla homestead. “He has since recovered, he is as fit as a bull,” a source within the Zuma inner circle said. Zuma’s health came under the spotlight in February following his failure to appear at the high court in Pietermaritzburg where he is facing corruption charges flowing from the arms deal in the 90s. Following a visit to Cuba, where he had been receiving treatment, the frail-looking Zuma in February told his supporters, who had gathered at the OR International Airport to welcome him, that his health was not good. “I also can’t see properly, that’s why I’m wearing these glasses,” Zuma said at the time. Since then, he has not given any further update on his health. “Yes, at the time he was not in a good shape but things have since changed. I last saw him a few weeks ago and he was in high spirits. From the look of things, I can confidently say that he has fully recovered,” another source close to the former resident said. However, Zuma’s spokesperson, Vukile Mathabela, declined to comment on the former president’s current condition. “We are not talking about that now. We will update the nation in due course,” he said. Zuma’s supporters in February vented their anger at Pietermaritzburg high court Judge Dhaya Pillay after she issued a warrant of arrest against the former president for his failure to show up in court. Zuma’s legal team had provided Pillay with a sick note, but the judge rejected it on the grounds that the document was drafted in a manner inconsistent with legal guidelines. The warrant was stayed pending Zuma’s next court appearance.
