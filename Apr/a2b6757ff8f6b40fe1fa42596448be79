The ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) on Sunday joined hands with the EFF in calling for a continued ban on the sale of cigarettes and alcohol. “It is commonly known that heavy smokers, especially those who are less fortunate, will practise ‘puff n pass’, which will increase the spread of Covid-19,” ANCWL KwaZulu-Natal provincial secretary Nonhlanhla Gabela said. This is after President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Thursday announcement in which he said the ban on the sale of cigarettes will be lifted from May 1, when the country enters a less strict level 4 lockdown. However, Gabela said there was a risk that the unbanning of cigarettes could trigger more Covid-19 infections. “Our major concern is that people with lung problems will be exposed to secondhand smoke, making them vulnerable to Covid-19. “We are also concerned about the wellbeing of children during this Covid-19 period. If cigarettes were to be unbanned we are likely to see more people smoking next to children as both schools and work places are currently closed,” she said. While the ANCWL acknowledged the contribution of cigarette sales to the economy, Gabela said the health of citizens should come first. “If we want to revive the economy then there are many other commodities that should be unbanned. As the ANCWL in KwaZulu-Natal, we don’t believe that this is the right moment to unban cigarettes,” she said. The ANCWL was currently lobbying government leaders as part of the fight to keep the sale of cigarettes banned. “As the KZN ANCWL, we are more biased to the fact that most women are non-smokers but die from secondary smoking complications,” she said. The ANCWL’s position on cigarettes and alcohol was at odds with that of the DA in the Western Cape, which had been calling for the lifting of the ban on both alcohol and cigarettes. The DA, which controls the Western Cape government, is of the view that the banning of the sale of alcohol and cigarettes adds little value to the fight against Covid-19.
