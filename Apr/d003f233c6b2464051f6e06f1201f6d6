The KNZ South African National Taxi Council (Santanco) is
waiting with bated breath to hear how it will be affected by the phased
lockdown approach. Santaco KZN chairperson Boy Zondi said while they would not
comment immediately, the taxi industry had been hugely impacted by the
lockdown. Zondi said they were awaiting more clarity from the Minister
of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, on the way forward. “Like all businesses the
industry is also under immense financial distress. “Taxi owners are struggling to pay salaries and instalments
for the vehicles. Rank marshals and administrative staff have also not been
paid. The impact is huge,” he said. He said the industry had no concrete plans in place to
recover for when the lockdown period is lifted. “The only way to recover is for
our taxis to operate. We have no other source of income.” In his address of Thursday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa
said public transport will continue to operate, with limitations on the number
of passengers and stringent hygiene requirements, including that all passengers
must wear a face mask. Zondi said long distance taxi owners have been particularly
hard hit. “At least taxis that are operating locally can make some
form of income, although it’s not much. It’s worse for long distance operators;
they can’t even move a vehicle out of their yards,” he said. The current lockdown regulations stipulate a 70% loading
capacity for minibus taxis. This means 15-seater taxis are only allowed to ferry 10
people at a time and minibuses with a 22-seater capacity are limited to a
maximum of 15 passengers. Zondi added that the industry has made submissions to
government for financial assistance.
