You are taking the lockdown seriously and you don’t want to leave home, yet you are sad, depressed and need help. Stop worrying, you can get help remotely with a professional using telephonic or virtual platforms. Local psychologist Prishika Pillay said there are a lot of lonely people out there who don’t want to travel. There are also some in unhappy relationships who are locked down with their partners and need help on how to cope. “I have patients who are even e-mailing me,” she said. Psychologist Clive Willows said that remote therapy is better than no therapy at all. However, medical aids have different regulations on whether or not they are paying and how much they are contributing. Therapy, especially for those who required it prior to the lockdown, should be continued, said the South African Society of Psychiatrists (Sasop). It has urged mental health-care users to be aware of early signs of relapse, continue with prescribed medication and to keep therapy appointments. Professor Renata Schoeman, board member of the Psychiatry Management Group, said mental wellbeing is vital now because lockdown can aggravate feelings of isolation — even more so for those already struggling with mental health issues. “Now is the time to re-focus one’s energy on improving your mental health and resilience. It is crucial to stay socially connected while practising physical distancing, to stay informed via credible sources of information, and to keep to generally healthy habits. “A strong individual and communal mental health status are key to remaining physically strong and socially cohesive during this crisis,” she said. Some practitioners have switched to “telehealth” as a contingency plan during lockdown, offering remote consultations via telephone or online platforms such as Zoom, in line with guidelines issued by the council. “Tele or video consulting is a means of delivering high quality treatment to vulnerable patients while protecting both them and clinicians from unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus,” said Schoeman. Sandy Lewis, a clinical social worker and the head of therapeutic services at Akeso mental health facilities, said there are a number of measures that can be taken to help lift spirits and to support one’s physical and mental health. “For those with families, the fact that we have fewer outlets to escape family situations may well place additional psychological strain on us and on our relationships, and this has the potential to result in conflict between family members. Given the uncertainties of the current situation, people may well be more irritable, tense and even volatile. It is a good idea to be conscious of, and acknowledge, this. There is a need for us all to be more understanding of one another at this time. “It can be a good idea to discuss these issues with your adult loved ones. One could address this by saying, ‘Look, we’re all most likely going to be more reactive than normal under these circumstances — let’s try to be aware of this and be as sensitive to one another’.” Lewis said that one can consider potential areas of conflict proactively and look at how you can reduce these. Should you find yourself in a situation of an explosive conflict, you can usually diffuse it by taking a 15-minute time-out from one another, and getting a break on your own, even if it is to go out into the garden or to sit on the fire-escape of your apartment block. In each case where you find tensions rising, ask yourself whether a particular issue is really worth the battle. n SA Depression Anxiety Group (SADAG): 0800 21 22 23 or 0800 70 80 90 n SADAG WhatsApp support (9 am-4 pm): 076 882 2775 or SMS 31393 or 32312 and a counsellor will call you back n Lifeline South Africa: 0861 322 322 n Department of Health: 060 012 3456 (WhatsApp “hi” for access to comprehensive Covid-19 information) n National Institute for Communicable Diseases toll-free Covid-19 hotline: 0800 0299 299 Visit www.sacoronavirus.co.za
