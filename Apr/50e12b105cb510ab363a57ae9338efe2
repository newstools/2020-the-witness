The Royal Agricultural Show has been cancelled, for only the second time since its inception in 1851. World War 2 was the first global event to stop the show. The Covid-19 pandemic is the second. The Witness reported in March that the RAS had hoped to stage the event, which generates more than R250 million for the Pietermaritzburg region, from July 24. RAS president Mike Moncur said that while he was disappointed the Royal would not be going ahead, they had to be guided by what Professor Salim Abdool Karim, the government’s chief adviser on Covid-19, had said about the pandemic possibly only reaching its peak in South Africa in September. Government yesterday revised this to October. That, coupled with the government’s phased lockdown strategy, meant that the Royal Show might only have been allowed to go ahead in November. “We agreed that we had to be fair to the exhibitors and especially to the farmers,” Moncur said. “We couldn’t let the farmers carry on preparing their animals for a show that wouldn’t happen.” Another major concern, Moncur explained, was around numbers, in particular the large groups of school children who attend the show in the middle of the week. In March, RAS chief executive officer Terry Strachan confirmed that two major events had already been cancelled — the University of Kwa­Zulu-Natal graduation ceremonies and a summit due to be hosted by the Department of Agriculture. The fate of The Witness Garden Show, which is due to take place in September, is also now in doubt. Organiser Tanya Visser said: “The garden show team is in the process of evaluating the current situation and will make an announcement in due course.”
