Wednesday may have been his first day on the job, but newly appointed Msunduzi municipal manager Madoda Khathide was already ticking off tasks on his to do list. This included sitting in meetings to devise strategies on how the city can arm itself in mitigating the spread of Covid-19. “It’s been a long day, but I enjoyed it,” said Khathide speaking to The Witness in between his meetings on Wednesday. “We are busy with Covid-19 issues more than anything, [so] I haven’t officially started my office duties.” Khathide, who was appointed last month, urged all residents to “keep themselves safe and locked inside.” Khathide takes over from embattled former manager Sizwe Hadebe, who resigned last August after being on suspension for more than a year pending disciplinary action on charges related to the contravention of tender and recruitment processes. Hadebe accepted a settlement offer from council as part of the deal to terminate the disciplinary action against him. Khathide, a seasoned local government official and former councillor in the Ladysmith’s Alfred Duma Municipality, holds several qualifications, including a masters in business administration in leadership. He previously served as the municipal manager for eDumbe local municipality in Paulpietersburg. He is also credited with obtaining a clean audit in 2013/2014 while municipal manager at the Ladysmith Municipality. While opposition parties in Msunduzi had objected to the recommendation to appoint Khathide during the recruitment process, on Wednesday, the provincial Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Department said the appointment is “substantively in accordance with prescribed requirements”. Cogta spokesperson Senzelwe Mzila told The Witness MEC Sipho Hlomuka has assessed and endorsed the appointment.
