Her mum, Megan Anderson, emphasised on Tuesday that Shadow the python is not a regular python. She is a ball python which is much smaller, very gentle and docile. “I got her for my daughter for her birthday in September 2018. My daughter loves all animals but is especially attracted to reptiles and has always wanted a snake as a pet. Also, they are a very low maintenance pet,” Anderson. The family live in Forest Lane in Hilton. Her daughter, Paige, has known Shadow from the time she hatched. Anderson’s friend is a breeder who she and her daughter often visit. “She [Paige] named her while she was with my friend and was the only snake with a name at his home,” said Anderson. She could not put a value on the snake, saying Shadow is priceless to them. “My daughter is absolutely devastated that she is missing and appeals to anyone that might see her to please contact us and not harm her.” Shadow lived in an enclosure in the family’s spare room. She used to live in Paige’s room but then they got her a bigger enclosure which did not fit in her room, so she needed to move into her “own” room, said Anderson. “We have absolutely no idea how she got out, it is an absolute mystery to us. We take her out of her enclosure almost daily, she comes into the bed with us, she swims with us, she is part of the family,” Anderson recalled that the only other time Shadow got out of her enclosure was the very first day they got her. “This was because I had not secured the lid, other than that she has never gone missing.” Anderson is concerned about how Shadow will survive on her own because she is used to being fed. Anderson is appealing to the public to contact her at 083 637 9254, if anyone finds or spots Shadow anywhere.
