The first One-Day International (ODI) between South Africa and England scheduled for Friday has been postponed to Sunday after one Proteas player tested positive for Covid-19. Cricket South Africa (CSA) and England Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed the postponement of the first ODI of the three-match series via a statement on Friday. “This decision results from a player from the Proteas team testing positive for Covid-19 after the teams’ last round of scheduled testing performed on Thursday ahead of the ODIs,” reads the statement. “In the interests of the safety and well-being of both teams, match officials and all involved in the match, the Acting CEO of CSA, Kugandrie Govender as well as the CEO of the ECB, Tom Harrison, have agreed to postpone the first fixture to Sunday.” This is not the first time a Proteas player returns a positive results as the team has had two players testing positive before their three match T20 series which was won by England by 3-0.
