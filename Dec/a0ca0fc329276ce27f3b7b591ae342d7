Eskom has announced that Stage 2 loadshedding will be
implemented starting at 10 pm until 5 am on Wednesday and again on Wednesday
night until Thursday morning. The power utility said this loadshedding is necessary to
preserve emergency generation reserves in preparation for higher demand
expected during January as economic activity resumes. During this period Eskom
will continue to pursue increased reliability maintenance as planned and
previously communicated. “We currently have 9 745MW on planned maintenance, while
another 11 346MW capacity is unavailable due to unplanned maintenance. Eskom
teams are working around the clock to return as many of these units to service
as soon as possible. Eskom will communicate timeously should there be any
significant changes to the power system,” said Eskom in a statement. Eskom requests the people of South Africa to use electricity
sparingly in order to help us limit the impact of loadshedding.
