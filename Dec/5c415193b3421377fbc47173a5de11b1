Airlink, a South African-based domestic and regional
airline, has adjusted its schedule of early morning and evening departures so
that customers can comply with the country’s new curfew with minimal disruption
to their travel plans. The changes will affect Airlink flights that were originally
due to depart prior to 8 am and arrive after 8 pm. These will be rescheduled to depart as soon after 8am as
possible, and where applicable to arrive before 8 pm. In some instances, flights might be consolidated.  These schedule adjustments will provide
customers departing on morning flights with sufficient time to commute to
airports and complete the necessary health, security and immigration checks
without breaking the curfew.   It will
also enable passengers landing on evening flights to complete the arrival
procedures and commute to their homes or accommodation by the 9 pm curfew. “The well-being and safety of our customers, crew and staff
is our priority.  At the same time we
want to provide continuity so that our customers reach their intended
destinations and that markets across Southern Africa remain connected with
positive economic consequences,” said Airlink Managing Director and Chief
Executive, Rodger Foster. The adjusted schedule will apply at least until January 15, 2021,
when the South African Government is due to review the efficacy of its adjusted
Level 3 lockdown restrictions in slowing the rate of Covid-19 infections in
hotspot areas. Airlink will communicate schedule changes with holders of
tickets for any affected flights. 
Customers should can also consult the flight schedule on the airline’s

by these temporary, but necessary, adjustments,” said Foster.
