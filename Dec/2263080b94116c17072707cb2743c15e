Maritzburg United boss Farook Kadodia has said players need to shoulder the blame for the fact that the team are at the bottom of the log and winless in the DStv Premiership. Maritzburg got closer to registering their first win of the season against Stellenbosch FC on Friday as they led twice, but their silly mistakes saw the game ending in a 2-2 draw. This was not the first time the Team of Choice delivered an error-ridden performance as it was also the case in their 2-0 defeat against Swallows a week ago.

Middendorp has been in charge of three games so far and managed to collect a meagre two points out of a possible nine. “The players have been making mistakes and they must be responsible and accountable. “You can see the structure that the coach has brought to the team, that’s very important,” said Kadodia. Kadodia also confirmed yesterday that four players from the club are currently in quarantine after they tested positive for Covid-19. The players were tested last week and had to miss the side’s Premiership clash against Stellenbosch on Friday. United return to training on Saturday to prepare for their clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at Harry Gwala Stadium on January 2.
