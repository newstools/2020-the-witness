The KwaSizabantu Mission will be approaching KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala’s office for clarity on what they described as “false” reports claiming that it organised a Covid-19 super-spreader event. In his press briefing held in Durban on Sunday Zikalala alluded to an event at the mission attended by more than 2000 people which resulted in 48 people being infected with Covid-19. However, Zikalala later clarified in a follow-up press statement that the event was actually in the form of a protest by local residents demanding to be employed by the mission. Following Zikalala’s clarification that the event was not organised by the mission, The Witness, which covered the Sunday briefing, later corrected an earlier version of its online story which created the impression that the event was organised by the church. However, the mission is of the view that the reports were part of a campaign to taint the image of the church. “The Mission is trying to contact the office of the Premier to establish the source of the misinformation, as anyone who creates fake news about the Coronavirus Covid-19 is liable for prosecution,” the church said in a statement. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the beginning of the year, the mission said the church had not held any live events. “The mission is actively engaged in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 virus, including intense awareness campaigns, strict implementation of health and safety measures at workplaces and supporting local communities most affected by Covid-19,” the church said. The mission is currently facing a number of investigations after former church members spoke out about human rights violations, including rapes and physical assaults which they claimed took place at the mission’s headquarters in Kranskop.
