 Former president Jacob Zuma’s trial, which was due to start at the Pietermaritzburg high court on Monday, has been postponed. Zuma is facing fraud, racketeering and money laundering charges in connection with his role in the arms deal in the 90s. According to the NPA, Zuma will not be in court tomorrow but counsel for the defence and prosecution will meet to discuss a new court date. However, in 2009 the NPA withdrew the charges, citing the poor conduct of some senior prosecutors and investigators. In 2018 the NPA reinstated the charges after a court described its decision to withdraw charges as “irrational”. However, the trial against Zuma is yet to resume. One of the reasons that led to the delay was that Zuma had initially attempted to block his trial by unsuccessfully applying for a permanent stay of prosecution — a process that took several months to conclude. Despite what some describe as Zuma’s delaying tactics, the former president’s supporters have put the blame for the delays on the NPA.  Zuma is also facing state capture allegations at the Zondo Commission where several witnesses have implicated him. OPINION | Zuma’s arguments at the Zondo Commission. Early last month the commission, which is looking at pressing criminal charges against Zuma after he slunk out of the inquiry without the permission of the chairperson, dismissed Zuma’s application for the recusal of Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo as chair. The commission has since determined that Zuma should appear before it next month. “The chairperson has determined the dates of 18 to 22 January 2021 and 15 to 19 February 2021 as the dates reserved for Mr Zuma to appear before the commission,” the commission’s secretary, Professor Itumeleng Mosala, said.
