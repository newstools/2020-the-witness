"At a time and season of Advent hope, this certainly comes as a deep wound to the Church, the congregation and the conference at large. This is a very painful reminder that the scourge of Covid-19 is yet to lessen its devastation in communities and society at large," LCCLSA president Nkhensani Shibambu said. "As the Leadership Conference of Consecrated Life we are deeply hurt by the loss of lives under this spell of Covid-19," she said. Shibambu urged all religious congregations and communities to be "extra vigilant and cautious in light of the deadly and subtle second wave". "None of us are immune to this pandemic. In the absence of a vaccine, we remain our own best defence against the virus and the least we can do is to continue adhering to the safety protocols of Covid-19 prevention and containment, especially as most people and communities gather for the celebration of the festive season and beyond," Shibambu said.
