A pilot was trapped doing 169 km an hour in a 120 km zone on the N2 on Tuesday afternoon. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said yesterday that the woman, who was driving a white BMW SUV, was arrested for speeding by the Gingindlovu RTI, near Fairbreeze, at about 4 pm. The Richards Bay resident was taken to the police station where she was released on R3 000 bail. She will appear in court on Wednesday. Mngomezulu said speedsters usually say they are in a hurry. What they donâ€™t realise is that when they get stopped, they will be delayed even more by officers who will want their details.
