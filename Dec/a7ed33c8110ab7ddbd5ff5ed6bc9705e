After several frustrating days, a zebra, nicknamed “Cyclops”, was finally freed from the snare around his neck in the Bisley Nature Reserve on Christmas Eve. The zebra was first spotted on December 21, but the animal and its herd kept disappearing into dense bush, making it virtually impossible to dart safely.  Peter West, spokesperson for the Friends of Bisley Nature Reserve, said all that changed when the group received a message on December 24 that the elusive zebra had been spotted at the Murray Road entrance. “Dave Bordman and Ron Hulley were there in no time and kept the herd of three under surveillance,” he added. “I contacted Dr Oliver Tatham, who ... met us where we were watching the herd about 100m away.” READ | Zebra freed from snare at Pietermaritzburg nature reserve He darted the animal. “Oliver quickly cut the snare, which was extremely tight, causing wounds where it had cut into the neck,” West said. “Oliver also discovered that the zebra had lost its sight in one eye. “After dressing all the wounds and injecting antibiotics, the antidote was delivered and in a few minutes he was up and calling for his mates. A few minutes later, they were grazing as if nothing had happened.”
