 It’s not every day your neighbourhood crocodile turns 120 years old, and so Crocworld Conservation Centre on the KZN South Coast gave their resident Nile crocodile a reason to smile on Wednesday, 16 December with a fitting birthday bash. James Wittstock, the centre’s acting manager, said the beloved Henry celebrated this milestone with his favourite meaty dish while Crocworld staff and guests enjoyed a slice of birthday cake. Wittstock said Henry, who is a whopping five-metre-long and 700 kilogramme croc, arrived at Crocworld in 1985 at the youthful age of 85, where he went on to father more than 10 000 offspring with his six female co-habitants.
