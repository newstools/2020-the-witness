Former Southern Kings lock Ashton Fortuin is set to make his debut for the Sharks against the Lions in the Carling Currie Cup this weekend but tighthead prop Thomas du Toit is ruled out for the clash. The Lions and Sharks are set to battle it out for Currie Cup crucial points at the Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday at 7 pm. Sharks coach Sean Everitt has made a few changes to the team that defeated the Bulls last weekend. The changes are only in the forward pack as the coach opted not to fiddle with his backline. Kerron van Vuuren is back as the starting hooker with the impressive Michael Kumbirai named as the tighthead prop after the loss of Du Toit to a rib injury sustained in the clash against the Bulls. JJ van der Mescht and Fortuin form a new second row partnership. Returning to the side and playing off the bench are front-row replacements Fezo Mbatha, Mzamo Majola and John Hubert-Meyer, while loose forward James Venter is another welcome returnee after missing recent action. Meanwhile, the Currie Cup match between the Griquas and the Bulls, which was scheduled to take place in Kimberley this Saturday, has been cancelled after players and management from the latter side returned positive tests for Covid-19. In a press release, the South African Rugby Union said the match would be declared a draw and both teams get two log points.
