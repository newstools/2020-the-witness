Napierville residents are rallying together to get police to attend to their complaints promptly. They have drafted a petition and are calling on residents to sign it. They plan to hand it over to the Prestbury Police Station, said the Napierville Resident & Ratepayer Association chairperson, Cedric Johnstone. The petition was launched following complaints from residents about a group of people who gather at the corners of Napier and Wiltshire roads, he said. Johnstone added that when residents contact the police to come over, they can’t get through.

Johnstone said they also want police to intervene when residents do not abide by the City’s by-laws when it comes to parties and loud music throughout the night and to respond when residents make complaints. He added that crime, such as housebreaking, is on the increase, saying: “Children are also being robbed at knifepoint while walking to the shop.” Police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, said that the normal procedure is that the public will contact the radio control centre at 10111. “A vehicle will then be dispatched. I would advise the residents to contact the central number if they need police assistance,” said Ngobese.
