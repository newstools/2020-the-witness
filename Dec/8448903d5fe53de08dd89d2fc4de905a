The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka has called for calm among the residents of the Richmond local municipality following an outbreak of the novel coronavirus at its offices. The MEC said reports received by the department indicate that a number of senior officials within the municipality have tested positive for Covid-19 and one has died. As a result, the municipality has closed its main offices and testing centre from Thursday to decontaminate the premises. He said the relevant departments have been engaged by the municipality and a contact tracing process is underway. Hlomuka has urged residents across the province to continue to be vigilant when in public by continuing to wear masks, sanitising and maintaining social distance. As the province and country deal with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hlomuka has appealed to all residents to utilise electronic means to access services from their municipalities, which include online payments to minimise the need to physically visit offices.
