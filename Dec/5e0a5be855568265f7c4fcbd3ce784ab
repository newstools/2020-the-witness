The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) has frozen the assets of four officials from the KwaZulu-Natal Premier’s department who are currently on trial for corruption. The officials, including the department’s chief financial officer Ziphathe Cibane, have been accused of corruption in the awarding of catering contracts. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said the frozen properties include vehicles and houses to the value of R23 million. “The state’s case is that the staff, who worked in the Supply Chain Management Section, colluded and unlawfully co-operated with these service providers to manipulate the tender processes. The items will be held under curatorship pending the outcome of the criminal trial,” the NPA said. READ | Head of KZN Public Works suspended Cibane and the three officials in the department’s supply chain management unit were arrested alongside four service providers. The accused, who are out on bail, are currently appearing at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court. The tenders involved were concluded before Premier Sihle Zikalala’s election. The officials, who will be back in court in April, are currently on suspension.
