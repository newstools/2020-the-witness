Pietermaritzburg police arrested two people for a business burglary and possession of suspected stolen property, including a car, in Sweetwaters on Tuesday morning. Spokesperson for Plessislaer police station, Sergeant Sifiso Gwala, told The Witness that community members in Sweetwaters helped police with information on two people suspected of breaking into the offices of a business in the Zayeka area. Gwala said when police arrived at around 6 am, the suspected burglars were cornered by the community police officers and were being questioned. He said police also found an instrument that was presumably used for burglary. Police then went to the home of the second man in Sweetwaters where a VW Golf, which was stolen in Pietermaritzburg, was recovered. The two men were arrested and are due to appear in court soon. Sergeant Gwala applauded the community and encouraged them to continue working with the police and not to take the law into their own hands.
