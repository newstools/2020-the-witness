The Sharks have confirmed that the kick-off time of their Carling Currie Cup clash against the Bulls on Saturday has been brought forward because of inclement weather. The top-of-the-table Currie Cup clash was initially scheduled to kick-off at 7 pm at Kings Park but now the game will start at 2 pm at the same venue on Saturday.

Vodacom Bulls has changed to 2 pm.” The Bulls will come to Durban seeking a victory that will see them securing a home semi-final in the Currie Cup while the Sharks look to minimise the gap between them and men from Pretoria, who are at the summit. The Sharks have 24 points after seven games while the Jake White-coached Bulls are on 32 but have played one more game compared to their hosts.
