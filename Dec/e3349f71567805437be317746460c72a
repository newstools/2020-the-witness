 She’s had a hair makeover and it’s a bit punk. Glamorous Princess Charlene of Monaco (42), mother of two, has ditched her signature classic bob and opted for a chic, sharp, sporty shaved cut. But, according to the Mailonline, not everyone is impressed. They said hairstylists have criticised the cut saying it’s too harsh and does not suit her. Brad Allen, owner of JellyFish LOS in Southend on Sea, told Mailonline, that he understood that people wanted a new look after lockdown but warned against getting anything as drastic as the “dreadful” new style. “I’m in total shock by the "transformation",' he told Mailonline. “I understand people may want to try something new after getting bored staring at the same cuts, colours, roots for months on end during lockdown. “But it’s not something I’d advise in such drastic measures. “Firstly, it’s a dreadful cut. It looks like one of her six-year old twins has done it. It doesn’t suit her elfin face and delicate features at all. The colour is too harsh too. The dirty golden tones make her overall blonde look dull and unflattering. “I really loved the simplicity of her former cut, and her ash blonde tones. But CEO of Abra Kadabra Hair & Healing Abra McField disagreed, saying, “If she loves it – so do I!”. “A lot of my clients are taking this time in quarantine to rock new looks – it's freeing. “People are going after what they really want and following their own style. I say good for her!” The Princess was photographed with Prince Albert, 60, and their six-year-old son Jacques handing out Christmas presents in Monaco.
