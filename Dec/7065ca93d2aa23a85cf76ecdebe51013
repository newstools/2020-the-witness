A man was killed and three road workers were injured when
the driver of a truck left the road on a sharp bend on the R617 Underberg Road,
near Lundies Hill, on Wednesday morning. Paramedics from the Underberg Emergency Medical Services
found the driver trapped inside the mangled wreckage. With the help of firefighters from Underberg and Howick they
managed to free him, but sadly he succumbed to his injuries. The injured road workers had been fixing a barrier when they
were hit by the truck. They sustained minor injuries and were transported to
hospital. The SAPS has launched an investigation into the cause of the
accident.
