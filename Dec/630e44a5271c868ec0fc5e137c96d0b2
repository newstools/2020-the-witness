We know that although this has taken away time for enjoyment from our people, it will certainly contribute to curbing the spread of the virus. "Our beaches are known for overcrowding during this time and people tend to be carefree. We urge people who will be going to the beach [on Thursday] and on days permitted, to ensure that it does not become a day of regret where people get infected and lives are lost. We plead with you to be responsible and protect yourself. Keep a physical distance from others, wear your mask and wash or sanitise your hands.  "We also note the various legal challenges that have been brought against government regarding the recent regulations. As the [Department of] Health, we stand by the recommendations made to the NCCC [National Coronavirus Command Council] which are well substantiated by evidence. We have every intention to oppose these applications as the department, and government's mandate to protect the lives and health of our people remains paramount. We dare not neglect this responsibility by omitting to take the necessary actions to protect the healthcare system from being overwhelmed and collapsing, as we've seen in other countries," Mkhize added.
