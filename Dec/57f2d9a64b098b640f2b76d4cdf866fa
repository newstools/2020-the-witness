Pietermaritzburg BMX Club are thrilled to end the year on a high after five of their riders claimed national titles at the South African BMX Championships at Giba Gorge Mountain Bike Park in Pinetown on Saturday. The winners from the local club are six-year-old Chad Carroll, Shai Duke-Norris, Alexandra Santos, Wade Botha and Tyler Thompson. Carroll, who only started in the sport last year, took top honours in the Under-6 category, while 11-year-old Santos, who got her SA colours last year, competed and reigned supreme in the category of the girls between 11 and 13. Duke-Norris, who represented South Africa at the 2019 UCI BMX World Championships in Belgium, walked away with SA1 Male Cruiser 30-39 title, as Botha finished as the champion in the SA1 men’s 17-24 category. The 15-year-old Thompson competed in the SA2 Boys 16 group as there weren’t enough riders to make the gate in his age group, so he won the SA1 age 15 category. Chairperson of the club Lauren Liddell said they were quite chuffed with the achievements of their riders as the fruits of the athletes’ hard work. “As the club we are very proud of our riders, we come from a small town in the middle of South Africa and our riders are winning national titles. We are very proud of them because they train really hard,” said Liddell. “We’ve got our little youngster Chad Carroll. He started racing only last year, he is six years old and he won SA1 Under 6. “11-years-old Alexandra Santos she raced in the 11-13 category which means she competed against girls who are two years older and she got SA 1,” she said. Liddell hopes the recent success will encourage other young people from the city to take up the sport as their club is always willing to help.
