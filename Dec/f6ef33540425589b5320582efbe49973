Under the agreement, the 93-year-old KZN company will position itself as the official provider of dairy products such as fruit juice, Asemzansimahewu, Multigrain and Yoghurt. The sponsorship takes a bit of pressure off CMA management as the race is still without a tier one sponsor after Bonitas medical aid pulled out.
