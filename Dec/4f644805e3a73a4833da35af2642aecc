A Durban community activist, Imtiaz Syed, has appealed
to South Africans to go on a self-imposed lockdown to alleviate the pressure
from the already strained health care services. In a heartfelt social media message, Syed who is from Ethekwini Secure, a community care organisation, said in the past four days he had
been to four funerals, three of which were Covid-19 related. "I have close friends that are currently in hospital for palliative care
which is becoming a difficulty." He said hospitals did not have enough beds and the queues at trauma centres
resulted longer waiting periods. He said ambulance services were also inundated
and unable to cope with the demand. "There is no one size fits all. Comorbidity is a major issue. The youth
are being affected daily. The response from the medical faculty is being
tested daily." He said the doctors were doing their best but there was challenge of inadequate
resources in the health care facilities. "Private hospitals across KZN have waiting lists for Covid beds in extent
of 10 to 20 at any point," said Syed. He said the burial services were also fatigued from having to operate 24 hours
as they had to attend to between 7 to 15 burials a day due to Covid-19. He said grave diggers were also tired and running on adrenaline. "Graves are filling up and space is becoming a problem. Funerals have fewer numbers that are attending and hands are short at the
grave for burial." Syed said the members of the public needed to stand up and take responsibility.
He said the government did not reinstate the hard lockdown to protect the
economy but he pleaded with people to initiate their own lockdown. "We are all in the same ship and lifeboats are few. Your lifeboat right now
is now to isolate yourself stay at home, wear a mask, limit contact, sanitise
and build responsibility. "If you get sick you will struggle to get help never blame the hospitals
or doctors, blame yourself, you have not been responsible."
