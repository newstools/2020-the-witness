Cricket South Africa (CSA) confirmed on Monday that the 4-Day Domestic Series encounter between the Titans and Dolphins in Centurion has been called off after one player returned a positive Covid-19 test on Sunday afternoon. The Dolphins’ player experienced symptoms during Day 1 of the red-ball fixture at SuperSport Park and, as per CSA’s Domestic Cricket Covid-19 protocols, a test was carried out. With player safety and welfare paramount during the Covid-19 hit cricket season, and taking in consideration the upcoming two-match Betway Test Series between South Africa and Sri Lanka, a decision was carried out to call off the match. CSA will determine whether the match will be rescheduled or if points will be shared between the two sides.
