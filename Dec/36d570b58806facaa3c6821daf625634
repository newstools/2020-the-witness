The South African National Defence Force (Sandf) said it is
aware of reports that are currently doing the rounds on social media about the
cancellation of leave of members. In a statement issued on Monday, Sandf said these reports on social media
platforms are not true. “The Sandf once again would like to caution the public not
to spread incorrect and irresponsible information.”
