Pietermaritzburg emergency workers spent more than five hours at the Howick Falls on Tuesday
recovering the body of a 66-year-old Hilton man who committed suicide. The incident happened
just before noon on Tuesday. The Witness was told
that the man was allegedly battling depression. Mark Winterboer,
director of Midlands EMS, told The Witness that the man’s body landed on a
protruding rock about 150 metres from the top. When The Witness
arrived at the scene on Monday afternoon, locals had gathered at the tourist
site watching as the Pietermaritzburg police Search and Rescue team along with
Midlands EMS emergency workers worked tirelessly to recover the body. Despite the drizzle
and mist, two rescue workers, were seen gliding down the rocky wall, just next
to the waterfall, to recover the man’s body. Winterboer said after
the two rescuers got the man’s body, they had to lower him down into the water,
then had to swim across the water with him. He said the family
stayed at the scene until his body was loaded onto the mortuary van.
