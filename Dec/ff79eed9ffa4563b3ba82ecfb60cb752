Members of the Swart family who had just returned from years spent sailing the high seas were treated to a South African welcome when they noticed a green mamba basking on the hedge near their Clansthal home on the KZN South Coast. Crocworld Conservation Centre’s Acting Centre Manager, James Wittstock, was contacted on Wednesday morning to attend to the serpentine guest. “I used my grabstick and managed to safely capture the mamba before putting her into a tub,” said Wittstock. “She appears to be gravid [pregnant] so we will keep her until she lays eggs, then we will release her and her babies to a safe location.” A DNA sample from the mamba will be taken to contribute to an ongoing study on black and green mamba genetics. Debby Swart extended her gratitude to Wittstock and the team from Crocworld for rescuing and re-homing the snake.
