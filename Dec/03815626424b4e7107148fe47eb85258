Sharks head coach Sean Everitt on Thursday named his team to face Griquas in Durban on Saturday, but once again had to implement changes for various reasons. Everitt said he was loathe to use Covid-enforced disruptions as an excuse because all teams are in the same boat, but it was a reality. “We’ve struggled with consistency in our selection due to Covid protocols and with injuries, it’s not ideal changing your team week after week and we’re losing important people as we go along,” said Everitt. “But that’s a problem all the teams are facing.” Three changes to the tight five see Fezokhule Mbatha, Michael Kumbirai and JJ van der Mescht all given starts with Thembelani Bholi also coming into the starting lineup. There is just one change at the back with Aphelele Fassi starting in place of Manie Libbok who left the field early after taking a knock last week but has recovered sufficiently to be named on the bench.
