During his address to the nation on Monday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that “cabinet has decided to put the country on an adjusted level 3 from level one” from midnight on Monday. Ramaphosa said the restrictions that apply on the new Level 3 will change based on what the government has learnt throughout the pandemic. He said all indoor and outdoor gathering, except for funerals, will be prohibited for 14 days. The President adjusted the curfew from 9 am to 6am. Ramaphosa said non-essential establishments, such as bars and shops, must close at 8 am. President Ramaphosa also announced that the sale of alcohol is no longer permitted. Nightclubs and bars that sell alcohol will not be allowed to operate, said Ramaphosa. He said despite the liquor industry being a major employer, “our priority at this time, however, is to save lives. Alcohol related incidents are putting pressure on our healthcare system,” said Ramaphosa. He said the new measures will be enforced until January 15, 2021. The President said not wearing a mask is now a criminal offence. “It is now compulsory for everyone to wear a mask, and it is now illegal for people to not report people who aren’t wearing masks,” said Ramaphosa. He said anyone not wearing a mask can be prosecuted and face a fine or six months’ imprisonment, or even both. All beaches, dams, lakes, rivers and parks will be closed to the public from Tuesday.
