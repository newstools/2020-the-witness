In less than five minutes on Tuesday morning in the Pietermaritzburg High Court, former president Jacob Zuma’s fraud and corruption case was adjourned to February 23, as a provisional date. Judge Nompumelelo Radebe granted a consent order which was agreed upon by all parties before the case was called up. It said the matter is being adjourned for the resolution of pre-trial management issues. The court is hoping to certify the matter as trial-ready when it returns to court.
