The weather office has issued a storm warning for much of KwaZulu-Natal today. This is ahead of a thunderstorm observed over Lesotho mountains moving towards southern KZN on Thursday. “Some of the thunderstorms expected to become severe. These storms are expected to be accompanied by heavy downpours, strong winds, hail and excessive lightning,” said the warning. They warned that strong winds and hail may lead to localized damages to infrastructure and vehicles. Heavy downpours may lead to localized flooding in low-lying areas as well as formal and informal settlements, and difficult driving conditions for motorists (leading to minor vehicle accidents). They advise as follows: “If outdoors seek shelter immediately but DO NOT seek shelter under a tree, under telephone lines and/or power lines. Avoid outdoor activities as hail, strong winds and flooding may result in injuries. Avoid low lying roads and bridges as they are susceptible to flooding. If possible stay indoors well clear of windows, shelter pets, cover vehicles and disconnect electrical appliances. Listen to the radio or TV for warnings and obey the instructions from disaster management officers. For further and latest updates, follow our social media platforms.”
