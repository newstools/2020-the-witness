Have you seen this woman? Pietermaritzburg detectives are hunting for a woman in connection with a case where a home buyer's email was hacked, resulting in her depositing money for transfer fees into the wrong account. They have asked the public to help them locate Thembisa Madliwa. A warrant for her arrest has been issued by the court. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said in a statement on Friday it is alleged that on April 9, a woman signed an offer to buy a house at Bisley and was told which lawyers would help with the transfer. “An amount of R157 000 was then deposited to the account number that was provided to the complainant by the lawyers. The complainant was surprised when she received a call from the lawyers that the money was not paid.” The woman then realised she’d been defrauded of her money. “A case of fraud was opened at Pietermaritzburg SAPS for further investigation. The investigation conducted revealed that Thembisa Madliwa (25) allegedly intercepted communication via the complainant and the attorneys by hacking the email.” Madliwa allegedly sent fraudulent banking details to the woman who subsequently deposited the money into Madliwa’s account. Anyone with information that will help police to arrest Madliwa can contact the investigating officer Constable Naidoo on 084 701 4825/ 033 845 2745. Crime Stop can be contacted on 08600 10111.
