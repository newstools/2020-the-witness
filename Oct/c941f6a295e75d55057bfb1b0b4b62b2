A Woodlands man appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday charged with the rape of an 11-year-old girl. The man, who can’t be named until he pleads to the charge, has been remanded in custody for seven days. The 45-year-old man is also charged with kidnapping. It is alleged that he kidnapped the girl while she was walking home from school and took her to the bush where he raped her. State prosecutor Renee Padayachee told the court that at this stage bail is opposed due to the seriousness of the offences and the prevalence of such crimes. She also said that the child’s safety is at issue should he be released on bail. His attorney, Kogulan Chetty, said that the man has no previous convictions or pending cases. He has also provided the court with an alternative address should he be granted bail. This still needs to be verified by the investigating officer. The man will appear again in court next week.
