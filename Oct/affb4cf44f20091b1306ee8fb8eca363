The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) has announced that the 2021 Comrades Marathon is scheduled to take place on June 13, 2021. This follows discussions between CMA with Athletics South Africa (ASA) and KZN Athletics last week, meaning the race date will remain unchanged from the second Sunday in June on which it has been staged for the past several years. The CMA Board has also confirmed that next year’s 95th Comrades Marathon will be a Down Run, starting at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall and finishing at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium, Covid-19 and Government restrictions permitting. CMA Chairperson, Cheryl Winn said, “With the inaugural Comrades Marathon having been staged on May 24, 1921, next year’s event promises to be a very special edition of the race with the hosting of the Comrades Marathon Centenary Celebrations hopefully commencing on  May 23, 2021.” She said more details on the #Comrades2021, especially information on the entry cap, entry fees and qualifying criteria, as well as protocols to be put into place to protect the health and safety of everyone involved with the race, will be made available at their official media launch.

It was cancelled, having initially been postponed from its original June 14, 2020, date. The CMA had been reluctant to cancel the race, but it eventually had to succumb to pressure from government and the realisation that the Covid-19 pandemic was still expected to peak in South Africa. Winn said they had some wonderful plans for the 2020 ‘Race That Never Was’ but said many of those ideas will be carried over to their Centenary Celebrations and make the 95th running of the Comrades Marathon a “spectacular affair.”
