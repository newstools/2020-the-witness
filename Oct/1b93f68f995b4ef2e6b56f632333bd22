the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court in Nelspruit. The 43-year-old former police officer and her 26-year-old co-accused
were found to have carried out the crime in 2017. "This unexplainable incident spiralled from an orchestrated plan
which was executed in 2017, at which ex-sergeant Lerato Mokoena, together with
Mduduzi Ndlovu, murdered Vusi Dlamini, her husband who was also a sergeant in
the police at the time," said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier
Leonard Hlathi. On the day of the crime, Mokoena and her husband went for a jog while
Ndlovu followed the couple, driving in Mokoena's vehicle. Ndlovu deliberately
ran over Dlamini, killing him instantly, says Hlathi. "The vehicle was so damaged to a point where it could not move
anymore, which forced Ndlovu to abandon it and flee the scene on foot. Mokoena
was left stranded at the scene with the lifeless body of her husband," he
said. Police and paramedics were notified about the incident and Dlamini was
certified dead at the scene. Police launched a manhunt for Ndlovu, who later
handed himself over. Hlathi said: Mokoena's bail was revoked and she was taken into custody after being
found guilty. The accused are expected to be in court again on 14 January for
sentencing.  Did you know you can comment on this article? Subscribe to News24 and add your voice to the conversation.
